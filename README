My program runs with 7 different files.
Here is the organization:

************************************************************
Server:

ChatServer.java	     //the main server.
ClientListener.java  //listens for messages.
ServerSender.java    //sends out message to the clients.

************************************************************                
Client:

ChatClient.java      //the main client.
ClientThread.java    //sends client messages to server.
GUIListener.java     //listens for events in the GUI frame.
ListenerThread.java  //listens for messages from the server.

************************************************************

EXECUTION:

To run the a chat room, run the ChatServer on
one console and open as many clients as you want.  
Each client will pop up a separate GUI frame.  The
command line args for the ChatClient and ChatServer
match the assignment specifications.

NOTE:

The program works fine as longs as you run my client
and my server.  They will not connect with the sample
solutions because I used a slightly different format
for the list of users.  I hope this will not result
in a significant point reduction.
